# Predictive-Maintenance-with-Sensor-Analytics
A machine learning project for predictive maintenance using real-time sensor data (Temperature, Vibration, Power Usage, Humidity) to detect potential machine failures. Built with Random Forest and SMOTE, this system improves maintenance planning and reduces equipment downtime.
